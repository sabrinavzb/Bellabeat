### **PREPARE**

The data used for the analysis was sourced from the Kaggle platform and came from the "Fitbit" dataset provided by arashnic (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit). This dataset was collected as part of a survey conducted through Amazon Mechanical Turk between December 3, 2016, and December 5, 2016. The survey was distributed among a group of participants and their responses were used to generate the dataset.
This data encompasses a comprehensive range of information related to fitness and health, including details on calories burned, steps taken, heart rate, sleep patterns, and daily physical activity. The data was collected from 33 consenting users and is presented in a variety of formats, including both long and wide formats, as well as in different time increments ranging from hourly to second-by-second.

However, it was discovered that not all data sets contained information from the full sample of 33 users, with some datasets containing a smaller number of observations. Despite these challenges, the data provides valuable insights into consumer behavior and health patterns and will inform the marketing strategy of Bellabeat.

The limited sample size of just 33 users and the lack of demographic information could result in a sampling bias, raising questions about the representativeness of the sample to the wider population. Additionally, the time frame of the survey, which spans only 2 months, may not provide a comprehensive picture of the data. Due to these limitations, it would be wise to approach this case study with an operational perspective. It's also important to note that the dataset is outdated, having been collected in 2016.

### **PROCESS** 

To process, clean and analyze the data, the R programming language was selected. The necessary packages were loaded in R Studio and the data was imported using the read_csv function. The data was thoroughly inspected using different functions and techniques to understand its characteristics and properties. By combining multiple data sets, new data sets were created that provide a more comprehensive view of the information being analyzed. A detailed explanation of the process can be located in the CaseStudy.r document.

### **ANALYZE**

R Studio was used as the platform for data analysis, where various functions were applied to conduct a comprehensive examination of the data set. The objective of this analysis was to uncover interesting relationships and patterns within the data. For example, by analyzing the data, it was discovered that there is a positive correlation between the number of steps taken and the number of calories burned, suggesting that the more steps a person takes, the more calories they are likely to burn. Furthermore, the data analysis also revealed insights into the activity level of the users and the frequency of usage of the smart device.
In order to gain a deeper understanding of the findings, it is recommended to refer to the CaseStudy.r document. 

### **SHARE**
Data was visually represented through graphs and charts made in R Studio to help better understand the results of the analysis. These visualizations were created to be easy to understand for a wide audience. A presentation was also made to clearly communicate the key findings from the data analysis and share the insights with others https://prezi.com/p/gsvrefecjyxq/?present=1.

### **ACT** 
A strategy, important findings, and future steps were added to the presentation. This made the presentation complete by showing not only the results of the data analysis but also what should be done next. The most important insights were carefully chosen to be included in the key takeaways section, which helps guide future decisions and drive progress.
